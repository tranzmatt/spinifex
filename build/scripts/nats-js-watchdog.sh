# JetStream liveness watchdog for spinifex-nats.
#
# NATS can stop accepting JetStream writes at runtime while the process stays
# alive and keeps serving reads. That is not a process failure, so
# Restart=on-failure never fires and KV-backed services (awsgw IAM bucket init,
# etc.) stall until NATS is restarted by hand.
#
# Two distinct latches produce that symptom, and they need different probes:
#
#   1. Server-wide. handleOutOfSpace calls ShutdownJetStream and sets an
#      internal disabled flag that only a restart clears. healthz reports it.
#   2. Per message block. filestore records a write error on the block and
#      returns it on every later write; nothing clears it short of a restart.
#      healthz does NOT report it, because the server-wide state is untouched —
#      only an actual write observes it.
#
# So a health check alone misses case 2 entirely. Both probes run here, and a
# sustained failure of either restarts the service. The multi-sample window
# avoids restarting during transient startup/quorum 503s.
#
# Three more guards sit around that decision, because "restart when the
# probes fail" is not safe on its own:
#
#   - Age gate: spinifex-nats.service is Type=simple, so it reports active the
#     instant the process forks, long before JetStream finishes replaying its
#     state. Acting before a recovery budget has elapsed restarts a server
#     that is still coming up, not one that has failed.
#   - Cooldown: a restart that did not fix things must not be retried by the
#     very next run, seconds later.
#   - Escalation: a restart that has not fixed things after several attempts
#     is not going to fix it on the next one either, and an unrunnable spx
#     must never be read as proof of a JetStream failure at all.
