// defaultStartupTimeout bounds how long Ensure's launch goroutine polls a
// freshly-launched serving VM's /v1/models endpoint before giving up and
// reverting the record to ABSENT.
//
// Measured once, on the only GPU available to test on: Llama 3.2 1B on an
// RTX A1000 reached "Application startup complete" 257.6s after launch, of
// which 20.7s was guest boot and 26.3s a cold torch.compile. The former 5min
// left ~42s of margin on the smallest model this platform can serve, so the
// bound is set well clear of the one data point rather than close to it. A
// larger card and a larger model are unmeasured, and the failure mode of too
// low a value is a healthy endpoint torn down mid-start; too high only costs
// a stuck launch more time to give up.

// waitReady polls baseURL + "/v1/models" every pollInterval until it returns
// HTTP 200 or ctx's deadline (set by the caller from startupTimeout) expires.
// Never a sleep in place of a real check: every non-200 (including connection
// refused, while the guest is still booting) is swallowed and retried, since
// readiness is the very thing being waited for. pollInterval is a parameter
// (not just the readinessPollInterval constant) so tests can poll fast
// without waiting out the production cadence.
