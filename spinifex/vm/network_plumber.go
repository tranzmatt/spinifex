// connectivity-critical datapath (patch + forward flows) was installed — only the
// IMDS demux/egress/reply stage failed, so the guest keeps VPC connectivity but
// cannot reach IMDS. Since guest bootstrap (SSH key, user-data, network, hostname)
// now comes from IMDS, this is launch-fatal: the caller aborts rather than boot a
// guest that would silently come up unconfigured. Any other error means connectivity
// was not set up and is equally fatal.

	// realises only the host datapath — serving is wired separately by the responder.
