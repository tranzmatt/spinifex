// Package nullprovider serves the EBSProvider contract without any storage
// behind it. It exists to establish the floor: a measurement taken against it
// is the cost of the contract, the transport and the control plane's own
// bookkeeping, with no engine, no object store and no disk in the number.
//
// It is not a type of its own. ebsprovider.MemoryProvider already answers
// every verb from a map, and natsserve already serves any EBSProvider, so a
// null provider is those two composed; this package only names that
// composition and states what it does and does not measure.
