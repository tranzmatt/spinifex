// BuildSubnetDHCPOptions returns the OVN DHCPOptions map for a subnet. Shared
// by the live manager and reconciler to prevent dns_server drift. IMDS is not
// steered via option 121: a guest either routes to it via the gateway, where the
// br-imds ingress demux catches it, or resolves it on-link, where the per-tap ARP
// responder answers. Both live in network/host/imds_datapath.go.

		// MTU wherever the egress path adds encapsulation: on an IPsec-protected
		// NAT path the measured path MTU is 1408, so a guest that believes 1442
		// advertises an MSS ~34B too large. Small packets pass; large inbound
		// segments (a TLS ServerHello + certificate chain, image layers) are
		// silently dropped, which surfaces as `TLS handshake timeout` rather than
		// as anything MTU-shaped. Advertise the conservative figure — a few bytes
		// of payload per segment is cheaper than a PMTU blackhole, and PMTU
		// discovery still raises the effective size per destination where the
		// path allows it.
