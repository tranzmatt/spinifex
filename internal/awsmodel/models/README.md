# AWS model cache

The conformance suite reads `api-2.json` from the Go module cache for the pinned `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go` version `v1.55.8`. Running Go tests or `go mod download` populates that cache; the large upstream model files are intentionally not tracked in this repository.

`ec2/error-codes.json` is separate from the SDK models because EC2's `api-2.json` declares no operation errors. It is a curated subset of the official [EC2 error-code reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/errors-overview.html): all documented common and server codes, plus the action-specific codes that Spinifex currently emits. The catalog records its verification date and must be reviewed against that source when it changes.
