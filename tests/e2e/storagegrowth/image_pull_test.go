// rewrites the same freed guest block addresses: that address reuse is what
// makes an append-only backend store grow by ~a full disk each cycle while
// guest usage itself stays flat, which is the phenomenon this mode exists to
// reproduce: the retry loop a real EKS GPU worker hit when its root disk was

// loop already running on the Go side can tag each sample with the cycle in
// flight when it was taken (see imagePullCurrentCycle).
//

// collapses onto the script's own exit code: a full disk mid-cycle is the

// collect. The EXIT trap's code — and therefore imagePullUnitStatus's
