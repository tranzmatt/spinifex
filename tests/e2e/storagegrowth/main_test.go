//go:build e2e

// Package storagegrowth drives guest workloads that make predastore's backing
// store grow faster than the data it holds, so an external step can measure the
// gap. Data should settle at ~1.5x its logical footprint — the RS 2+1 erasure
// floor (data=2 parity=1 yields three half-size shards, which is not 3x
// replication) — plus a small AES-GCM fragment-framing overhead. Anything above
// that, and especially anything that grows monotonically, is a leak.
//
// It exists to isolate the *unreferenced-live* leak, which only a real guest
// workload can produce: viperblock mints chunk objects under unique monotonic
// keys, so they are never overwritten. It simply stops referencing an old chunk
// and never issues a Delete. predastore is behaving correctly by its own lights
// — nobody told it the object is garbage — so it counts those bytes LIVE.
//
// That is a different fault from the *overwrite-orphan* leak, where a key is
// rewritten in place and the superseded extent is never tombstoned, so
// compaction can never find it. Keeping the two apart matters for attributing
// blame within a leak, and that attribution is why this package's own
// in-process check stops at a coarse pass/fail gate rather than a full
// breakdown. The two leaks are distinguished precisely by predastore's own
// live-versus-dead split: unreferenced-live bytes inflate live totals,
// overwrite-orphan bytes inflate dead totals. A host-side `du` reports one
// number that mixes them, which cannot separate the target from the confound
// — and this workload drives both at once, because the drain each pass
// forces also rewrites the checkpoint map in place. Splitting that mix
// requires a tool that reads predastore's live-versus-dead accounting
// directly; that tool does not exist in a standalone spinifex checkout, and
// depending on it here would break this suite's CI.
//
// What this package's own tests DO assert on, in-process, is the coarser
// signal a node-wide `du` delta across the workload can still catch: the
// combined live+dead footprint growing well beyond the RS-erasure floor
// (see assertNPassBackendByteDelta in storage_growth_test.go). A per-volume
// S3 listing of the volume's own chunk prefix — what this suite originally
// used, and what the external tool below also reads — turned out to be
// unusable against a live deployment: the internal chunk bucket is owned by
// a system account distinct from the tenant-scoped identity this harness
// authenticates as, and predastore's same-account bucket-ownership check has
// no cross-account bucket-policy escape hatch, so every such listing fails
// closed with AccessDenied regardless of IAM grants. `du` needs no S3
// credential at all, only SSH to the node, which is why it is what this
// package can actually run itself.
//
// The division of labour: this package drives the guest, runs its own
// coarse node-wide gate, and reports what it did (see npassWorkload); an
// external measurement step reads that record for the measured denominator
// and supplies the fine-grained live-versus-dead backend breakdown this
// package cannot produce on its own. Run standalone, the workload still
// asserts every guest-side invariant, and the coarse gate, that it can see
// on its own.
//
// This is its own package rather than living in single/ or multinode/:
// single/ shares one singleton instance across the whole package that a
// multi-pass, multi-MiB workload would wreck for sibling tests, and
// multinode/'s fixture hard-skips outside ModeMultinode — meaningless on
// the single-node topology this fault was observed on. It is also
// deliberately excluded from the default e2e run and from
// docs/service-interfaces.yaml: like gpu/, select-suites never selects it
// automatically, so it is driven only by its own `make e2e-storagegrowth`
// target. Nothing under tests/e2e/harness/ is modified by this suite —
// that path is an infra glob, and editing it forces the full CI matrix on
// every change.
