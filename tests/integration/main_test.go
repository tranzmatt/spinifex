// TestMain amortises the embedded NATS+JetStream server across every test in
// this package instead of each StartGateway call booting (and tearing down)
// its own, for two reasons:
//
//  1. spinifex/gateway/ec2/instance's ClientTokenStore is a process-wide
//     sync.Once singleton bound to whichever *nats.Conn first initialises it.
//     In production a gateway holds one long-lived connection for its whole
//     life, so the singleton is correct there. But this test binary runs
//     every test in one process, so a per-test embedded server closes that
//     first connection the moment its owning test ends — every later
//     RunInstances-calling test then inherits a KV handle bound to a dead
//     connection. Keeping one server, and never closing an individual
//     test's connection early, keeps whichever connection wins the
//     singleton alive for the life of the whole binary.
//  2. It cuts per-test startup cost: standing up an embedded JetStream
//     server is the dominant fixed cost of StartGateway.
//
// Per-test state isolation is preserved despite the shared server — see the
// accountAuthenticator doc comment in shared_nats.go for how.

	// Connections are closed here, together, rather than per-test: closing
	// one early can kill the connection the clienttoken singleton latched
	// onto (see above), so every connection's lifetime is pinned to the
	// whole binary rather than to any single test.
