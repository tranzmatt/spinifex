# Which e2e suites each topology can run. Sourced by every workflow that drives
# suites (e2e.yml, e2e-suites.yml, e2e-nightly.yml) so the lists cannot drift
# apart — they previously disagreed three ways.
#
# Eligibility is a property of the suite, not of the workflow: a suite belongs
# to a topology when all of its assertions are reachable there. lb is
# multi-only for exactly that reason — on a single node every internet-facing
# subtest skips for want of a peer, so a single-node lb run reports green
# having exercised a fraction of the suite.

# Suites runnable against a one-node environment.
#
# partialblock gates merges because it earned it, not because it is new: on one
# node, same binary and workload, it fails against the pre-fix engine (1758 of
# 8192 halves reverted a generation) and passes against the fixed one (0 of
# 8192). A suite that has never been shown to go red for the reason it claims
# does not belong here.
# rds is single-only for the opposite reason to lb: v1 has no multi-AZ
# behaviour, so a second node adds no assertion. Its DB VMs are capped at four
# concurrent by the suite's own semaphore, which is what keeps it inside the
# job's 50-minute budget alongside the suites above.
# quota belongs to both topologies because the gate it asserts is gateway code
# that runs identically on either, and because a quota left switched on would
# cap every suite sharing the environment — so it must be proved to restore
# itself wherever it runs, not only on one node.
