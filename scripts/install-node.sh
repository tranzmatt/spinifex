#!/bin/bash
# install-node.sh — form a multi-node Spinifex cluster across running nodes.
#
# Every node installed from the ISO comes up as its own single-node cluster.
# This script converts a set of them into one cluster: it rebuilds the OVN
# database in clustered form, runs `spx admin init` on the first host and
# `spx admin join` on the rest, restarts services and verifies the result.
#
# It is the scripted form of docs/install/install-multi-node. It installs no
# software — every host must already be running the version you want. Use
# mulga's scripts/update-nodes.sh, or the release installer, for that first.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/install-node.sh --external-pool 10.0.1.100-10.0.1.150 \
#       --external-gateway 10.0.1.1 --external-prefix-len 24 \
#       node1.example.com node2.example.com node3.example.com
#
# The first host is the init node; the rest join it.
#
# Options:
#   --external-pool A-B      Public IP range for instances (required)
#   --external-gateway IP    Gateway for that range (required)
#   --external-prefix-len N  Prefix length of the range's subnet (required)
#   --external-iface NAME    WAN NIC for br-external (default: auto-detected)
#   --node-names A,B,C       Cluster node names (default: node1..nodeN)
#   --lan-bridge NAME        Bridge carrying internal cluster traffic
#   --vpc-bridge NAME        Bridge carrying Geneve overlay traffic
#   --region R               Region (default: ap-southeast-2)
#   --az AZ                  Availability zone (default: <region>a)
#   --email ADDR             Operator email for update and security notices
#   --user U                 SSH user (default: spinifex)
#   --identity FILE          SSH private key
#   --hosts-file FILE        One host per line; blank lines and # comments ignored
#   --token-ttl D            Join token validity (default: 30m)
#   --wipe                   Reset every host to its pre-install state first.
#                            Destroys all data on ALL hosts, including the first.
#                            Confirmed separately from --yes; unattended runs
#                            must set SPX_WIPE_CONFIRM=wipe.
#   --smoke                  Run smoke-test.sh --create-vpc on the first host
#   --no-firewall            Leave the host firewall alone, for debugging
#   --yes                    Skip the confirmation prompt
#   --dry-run                Print what would happen and touch nothing
#
# THE HOST FIREWALL
#
# Nodes installed from the ISO boot armed, scoped to the only cluster member
# they know: themselves. Forming a cluster means talking to hosts that are not
# members yet, so the policy is taken down before the OVN database cluster is
# built and put back once the cluster is up. Skipping this does not produce a
# slow formation, it produces one that cannot happen at all.
#
# WHAT THIS DESTROYS
#
# Forming a cluster is not additive. --recreate-db discards all OVN logical
# network state on every database node, and `spx admin join --force` replaces
# each joining node's CA and master key with the first host's. Every VPC,
# subnet and instance on the joining nodes is lost. That is safe on freshly
# installed servers and unrecoverable on ones that have been in service.
