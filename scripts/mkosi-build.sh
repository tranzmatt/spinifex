#!/usr/bin/env bash
# mkosi-build.sh — run an mkosi system-image build inside the pinned builder
# container.
#
# The runner needs only Docker: the toolchain is baked into the image (see
# scripts/mkosi-builder.Dockerfile), so nothing is installed on the host and
# the build cannot drift between runners. The same command runs identically on
# a developer's box.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/mkosi-build.sh --image <name> [--shell] [-- <mkosi options>]
#   scripts/mkosi-build.sh --profile <name> [--profile <name>...] [--shell] [-- <mkosi options>]
#
#   scripts/mkosi-build.sh --image spinifex-eks-node-gpu
#   MKOSI_VERB=clean scripts/mkosi-build.sh
#
# --image is the interface to prefer: it names an output and expands to the
# right ordered profile list. --profile is the escape hatch for ad-hoc builds
# and puts the ordering rule below on the caller.
#
# --image also names the artefact: the build writes <image>.raw, so what a
# composition produced is legible from the output rather than inferred from
# which build ran last. Profile-mode builds keep the base config's ImageId.
#
# Builds are always forced; see the --force note further down for why mkosi's
# own skip logic is not a cache worth having here.
#
# Args after `--` are mkosi OPTIONS only; the verb comes from MKOSI_VERB.
#
# Env:
#   MKOSI_IMAGE_DIR   directory holding mkosi.conf (default: images/)
#   MKOSI_OUTPUT_DIR  where artefacts land (default: <image dir>/output)
#   MKOSI_VERB        mkosi verb to run (default: build)
#   BUILDER_TAG       builder image tag (default: spinifex-mkosi-builder)
