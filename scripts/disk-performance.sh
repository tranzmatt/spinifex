# disk-performance.sh — fio random 70/30 read-write swept across block sizes.
#
# Usage: disk-performance.sh
#
# Environment:
#   BENCH_DIR    Where fio writes its data files (default: $HOME/bench)
#   OUT_DIR      Where JSON results are written (default: /tmp/spinifex-disk-bench)
#   SIZE         Per-job file size (default: 256M)
#   JOBS         Concurrent jobs (default: 4)
#   BLOCK_SIZES  Block sizes to sweep (default: "4k 16k 128k 1M")

BLOCK_SIZES="${BLOCK_SIZES:-4k 16k 128k 1M}"

# BENCH_DIR stays on the disk under test and must not move to /tmp: where /tmp
# is tmpfs this would measure RAM and report a number that looks excellent and
# means nothing. Only the JSON results go to /tmp.
#
# SIZE defaults small because JOBS x SIZE at direct=1 already defeats the host
# page cache. Measuring a guest volume through nbdkit/viperblock/predastore is
# a different question and wants several GiB per job — raise SIZE for that.
