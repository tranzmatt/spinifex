# eks-node-role — first-boot role selector for the unified eks-node AMI.
#
# The same image boots either as a K3s control-plane server or a worker agent;
# the role is chosen per-instance at first boot from SPINIFEX_K3S_ROLE in the
# cloud-init env file. This script enables + starts the matching services
# under whichever init the image ships (none are enabled at bake time),
# records the resolved role to ROLE_FILE so later boots and the etcd-snapshot
# cron can branch without re-parsing, then disables itself so it runs exactly
# once.
#
#   server      → eks-token-webhook, k3s (server), k3s-first-boot (bootstrap
#                 publish), mulga-eks-state-report
#   server-join → eks-token-webhook, k3s (server, joins the first server's etcd
#                 quorum), mulga-eks-state-report. NO k3s-first-boot: the first
#                 server already publishes the cluster-identical bootstrap
#                 artifacts; a join re-publish only races the bootstrap bus.
#   agent       → k3s-agent
#
# Paths are overridable via env so the selection logic is unit-testable (bats)
# without root or a real /etc.
