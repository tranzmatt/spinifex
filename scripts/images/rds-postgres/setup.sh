# the libguestfs appliance under build-system-image.sh, after packages and
# INSTALL_FILES are placed.

# INSTALL_FILES land 0644; OpenRC requires 0755 on init scripts, and rds-init
# and rds-datadir are executed directly by their services.

# mulga-mgmt-net goes in the boot runlevel, not default (where ENABLE_SERVICES
# lands services). It applies mgmt0's static address, which rds-agent needs to
# reach the gateway at all, and DHCPs the data NIC so the init-local Ec2 crawl
# reaches IMDS; a default entry runs after cloud-init-local and is too late.

# so the delivery lands in a root-only directory.
