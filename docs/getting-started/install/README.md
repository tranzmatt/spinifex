## Overview

Spinifex is an open-source infrastructure platform that brings core AWS services to bare-metal, edge, and on-prem environments.

This guide installs Spinifex on a single server using the binary installer. For multi-server clusters, see [Multi-Node Install](/docs/install-multi-node). To build from source, see [Source Install](/docs/install-source).

**Supported Operating Systems:**

- Ubuntu 26.04
- Debian 13

**What Gets Installed:**

- Spinifex daemon and CLI
- QEMU/KVM for virtual machine management
- OVN/Open vSwitch for VPC networking
- Predastore (S3-compatible object storage)
- Viperblock (EBS-compatible block storage)
- AWS CLI v2

## Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Prerequisite — WAN bridge required.**
>
> Before running the installer, the host's WAN interface **must** already be enslaved to a Linux bridge named `br-wan`. The host IP, default route, and DHCP must all live on the bridge — not on the bare NIC.
>
> The bootstrap installer does **not** create this bridge for you yet. Running it on a host whose default route is still on a bare NIC will leave the install in a non-working state. Auto-provisioning of `br-wan` will land in the next release.
>
> **Verify before continuing:**
>
> - `ip -br link show br-wan` — bridge exists and is `UP`
> - `ip route` — default route's `dev` is `br-wan`
>
> **Setup references:** [VPC Networking → Bridge Setup](/docs/vpc-networking#bridge-setup-physical-network-wiring) for the topology.

## Instructions

## Step 1. Install Spinifex

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.mulgadc.com | bash
```

The installer downloads the Spinifex binary and bootstraps all dependencies (QEMU, OVN/OVS, AWS CLI).

## Step 2. Setup OVN Networking

If your WAN interface is already a bridge (e.g. `br-wan`), setup-ovn.sh auto-detects it:

```bash
sudo /usr/local/share/spinifex/setup-ovn.sh --management
```

If your WAN is a physical NIC:

```bash
sudo /usr/local/share/spinifex/setup-ovn.sh --management --wan-bridge=br-wan --wan-iface=eth1
```

**Separating VPC tunnel traffic from WAN:** If you want Geneve tunnel traffic (inter-VM east-west for VPC traffic) to use a dedicated interface instead of the WAN IP, add `--encap-ip=<IP>` to specify the tunnel endpoint address:

```bash
sudo /usr/local/share/spinifex/setup-ovn.sh --management --encap-ip=10.0.0.1
```

This is recommended for production and required in multi-node deployments. See [Multi-Node Install](/docs/install-multi-node) for details.

## Step 3. Initialize

```bash
sudo spx admin init --node node1 --nodes 1
```

This auto-detects your network topology, generates configuration and TLS certificates, installs the CA into the system trust store, and configures AWS CLI credentials (saved in `~/.aws/credentials`)

## Step 4. Start Services

```bash
sudo systemctl start spinifex.target
```

## Step 5. Verify

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=spinifex
aws ec2 describe-instance-types
```

If this returns a list of available instance types, your installation is working.

**Congratulations! Spinifex is installed.**

Continue to [Setting Up Your Cluster](/docs/setting-up-your-cluster) to import an AMI, create a VPC, and launch your first instance.

## Troubleshooting

### spx Command Not Found

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
```

### CA Certificate Not Trusted

`sudo spx admin init` installs the CA automatically. If you need to re-install it manually:

```bash
sudo cp /etc/spinifex/ca.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/spinifex-ca.crt
sudo update-ca-certificates
```

### OVN Services Not Starting

```bash
sudo systemctl is-active ovn-controller
journalctl -u ovn-controller --no-pager -n 20
```
