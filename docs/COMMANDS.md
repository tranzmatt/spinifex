# Command Implementation Matrix

## Spinifex Admin CLI

Platform management commands not exposed via the AWS gateway API. These are CLI-only commands.

### Service Management

Service lifecycle commands for starting, stopping, and checking status of all Spinifex cluster services. Each service subcommand supports `start`, `stop`, and `status` operations.

| Command | Flags | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `spx service predastore start` | `--port` (default: 8443, the host's S3 gate port), `--host` (default: 0.0.0.0, the address the host's sockets bind), `--base-path` (directory holding the service pid file), `--config-path` (required), `--tls-cert` (required), `--tls-key` (required), `--encryption-key-file` (required), `--host-id` (required; names a `[[host]]` in the predastore config) | Creates predastore service instance with S3-compatible storage backend → starts service, serving that host's nodes and the S3 gate among them until the process is signalled. When `--config`/`SPINIFEX_CONFIG_PATH` points at a cluster spinifex.toml, `--host`/`--port`/`--host-id` default to that node's `[nodes.<node>.predastore]` section instead of the flag defaults above; an explicit flag or `SPINIFEX_PREDASTORE_*` env var still overrides it. `host_id` absent from spinifex.toml resolves to 0, which names no host and is rejected. |
| `spx service predastore stop` | — | Stops the predastore service |
| `spx service predastore status` | — | Reports predastore service status |
| `spx service viperblock start` | `--s3-host` (default: 0.0.0.0:8443), `--s3-bucket` (default: predastore), `--s3-region` (default: ap-southeast-2), `--plugin-path` (auto-detected via `nbdkit --dump-config plugindir`; typically `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/nbdkit/plugins/nbdkit-viperblock-plugin.so` on amd64, overridable via `SPINIFEX_VIPERBLOCK_PLUGIN_PATH` in `/etc/spinifex/systemd.env`) | Loads cluster config → connects to NATS and Predastore → starts viperblock block storage service with NBD plugin |
| `spx service viperblock stop` | — | Stops the viperblock service |
| `spx service viperblock status` | — | Reports viperblock service status |
| `spx service nats start` | `--port` (default: 4222), `--host` (default: 0.0.0.0), `--debug`, `--data-dir`, `--jetstream` | Starts embedded NATS server with optional JetStream |
| `spx service nats stop` | — | Stops the NATS service |
| `spx service nats status` | — | Reports NATS service status |
| `spx service spinifex start` | `--wal-dir` | Loads cluster config → starts spinifex daemon (VM orchestration, NATS subscriptions, health endpoint) |
| `spx service spinifex stop` | — | Stops the spinifex daemon service |
| `spx service spinifex status` | — | Reports spinifex daemon service status |
| `spx service awsgw start` | `--host` (default: 0.0.0.0:9999), `--tls-cert`, `--tls-key`, `--debug` | Loads cluster config → starts AWS-compatible gateway with SigV4 auth, IAM policy enforcement, TLS |
| `spx service awsgw stop` | — | Stops the AWS gateway service |
| `spx service awsgw status` | — | Reports AWS gateway service status |
| `spx service spinifex-ui start` | `--port` (default: 3000), `--host` (default: 0.0.0.0), `--tls-cert`, `--tls-key` | Starts embedded web UI server serving the React frontend. Aliases: `ui`, `spinifexui` |
| `spx service spinifex-ui stop` | — | Stops the spinifex-ui service |
| `spx service spinifex-ui status` | — | Reports spinifex-ui service status |
| `spx service vpcd start` | — | Loads cluster config → starts VPC daemon (subscribes to `vpc.*` NATS events, translates to OVN logical switches/ports/routers) |
| `spx service vpcd stop` | — | Stops the vpcd service |
| `spx service vpcd status` | — | Reports vpcd service status |
| `spx service northstar start` | `--northstar-config` (overrides `nodes.<node>.northstar.config_path`) | Loads cluster config → reads `northstar.toml` → starts the northstar DNS server (authoritative for internal `*.spx3.net`, recursive via upstream forwarders), syncing zones from its S3 bucket. Guests resolve via `169.254.169.253`, served by vpcd's per-tap DNS shim which forwards to northstar |
| `spx service northstar stop` | — | Stops the northstar service |
| `spx service northstar status` | — | Reports northstar service status |
| `spx service qmp-collector start` | — | Starts the guest-metrics collector (polls per-VM telemetry QMP sockets + tap counters, publishes CloudWatch-shaped series to NATS `metrics.ec2.*`) |
| `spx service qmp-collector stop` | — | Stops the qmp-collector service |
| `spx service qmp-collector status` | — | Reports qmp-collector service status |

### Cluster Inspection

Operational commands for inspecting cluster state. These fan out NATS requests to all nodes and aggregate responses.

| Command | Flags | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `spx get nodes` | `--timeout` (default: 3s) | Loads config → publishes to `spinifex.node.status` fan-out topic → collects responses within timeout → merges config-known nodes with NATS responders → nodes that don't respond shown as `NotReady` |
| `spx get vms` | `--timeout` (default: 3s) | Publishes to `spinifex.node.vms` fan-out topic → collects VM info from all nodes → sorts by node then instance ID → prints table. Alias: `spx get instances` |

### Resource Monitoring

| Command | Flags | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `spx top nodes` | `--timeout` (default: 3s) | Publishes to `spinifex.node.status` fan-out topic → collects CPU/memory usage per node → aggregates instance type capacity across all nodes → prints two tables: per-node resource usage and cluster-wide instance type availability |

### Cluster Initialization

| Command | Flags | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `spx admin init` | `--nodes`, `--node`, `--bind`, `--port`, `--region`, `--az`, `--cluster-name`, `--cluster-bind`, `--cluster-routes`, `--predastore-nodes`, `--services`, `--formation-timeout`, `--token-ttl`, `--force`, `--skip-host-dns`, `--external-mode` (`pool` \| `nat` routed NAT for non-bridgeable uplinks, single-node; pair with `setup-ovn.sh --nat-uplink`; add `--external-pool start-end --external-gateway <ip>` or `--external-source=dhcp [--external-bind-bridge <iface>]` for a public pool with full EIP support; note: system instances (ECS/EKS/load-balancer agents) are unsupported in nat v1 — they require `pool` mode) | Generates root IAM credentials (AKIA-prefixed access key + secret) → creates master.key (AES-256, 32 bytes, 0600) → writes bootstrap.json (consumed on first start) → generates CA + server TLS certificates → generates join token (written to `join-token` file, displayed in join command) → creates NATS config with auth token → writes spinifex.toml, awsgw.toml, predastore.toml → configures AWS CLI `spx` profile → creates directory structure under `~/spinifex/` → points the host resolver at this node's local northstar so the Spinifex zones (ELB/EKS names) resolve from the node itself (opt out with `--skip-host-dns`). `--force` on an already-initialized node is idempotent for crypto: it preserves the existing keys (master.key, predastore/viperblock encryption keys), system + admin credentials, and CA, and refreshes only the config files and the CA-signed server certificate (so a changed bind IP / SANs is picked up without breaking already-joined nodes or CA-baked AMIs). A genuine clean slate requires removing the data dirs first. |
| `spx admin join` | `--host` (required), `--node` (required), `--token` (required), `--bind`, `--port`, `--region`, `--az`, `--cluster-bind`, `--cluster-routes`, `--data-dir`, `--services`, `--skip-host-dns` | Connects to leader node with join token (Authorization: Bearer header) → retrieves cluster configuration → configures local node to join cluster and participate in distributed operations → points the host resolver at this node's local northstar so the Spinifex zones resolve from the node itself (opt out with `--skip-host-dns`) |

### Version

| Command | Flags | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `spx version` | — | Prints Spinifex version, commit hash, OS, and architecture (populated via build-time ldflags) |

### Cluster Operations

| Command | Flags | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `spx admin cluster shutdown` | `--force` (shutdown even if nodes don't respond), `--timeout` (max wait per phase, default 120s), `--dry-run` (print phase plan without executing) | Performs coordinated, phased shutdown of entire cluster. Phases execute in order: GATE (stop API/UI) → DRAIN (stop VMs) → STORAGE (stop viperblock) → PERSIST (stop predastore) → INFRA (stop NATS/daemon). Each phase waits for all nodes to ACK before proceeding. Uses JetStream state tracking. |
| `spx admin cluster drain-dhcp` | `--timeout` (reply-collection window, default 30s) | Asks each vpcd to DHCPRELEASE every external-pool DHCP lease it currently holds, returning them to the upstream DHCP server. Run on teardown before stopping services — an env reset otherwise strands held leases upstream until their TTL expires, eventually exhausting the upstream scope. Best-effort: warns and exits 0 if the cluster is already down. |
| `spx admin node drain --local` | `--local` (drain the local node only, required), `--timeout` (max wait per phase, default 120s) | Runs the GATE and DRAIN phases against the local node only: powers down its guests via QMP and unmounts their volumes (flushing the viperblock WAL) while every service is still up. STORAGE/PERSIST/INFRA are left to systemd's ordered teardown. Wired as the `ExecStop` of `spinifex-shutdown.service`, so `systemctl stop spinifex.target` and host reboot/poweroff drain guests before any storage service stops. |

### Certificate Management

| Command | Flags | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `spx admin cert renew` | `--extra-ip` (additional IPs for SANs), `--extra-dns` (additional DNS names for SANs) | Reads existing CA → regenerates server certificate with all current network interface IPs and machine hostname in SANs → writes new cert. Use after adding a new network interface or changing IP addresses. |
| `spx admin cert create-tenant-ca` | `--domain` (required, repeatable — permitted domains baked into the CA's name constraints), `--regenerate` (replace an existing tenant CA, requires confirmation), `--yes` (skip the `--regenerate` confirmation prompt) | Creates the tenant root CA that ACM's `PRIVATE_CA` validation mode signs leaf certificates from — a separate, independent root from the platform CA. Idempotent: running it again against an existing tenant CA reports the current state rather than regenerating; `--regenerate` is required to replace the root, which invalidates every device's existing trust. |

### Upgrade Management

| Command | Flags | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `spx admin upgrade` | `--yes` (apply without prompting), `--dry-run` (report pending config and unit changes without applying), `--units-only` (reconcile systemd units only, skip config migrations), `--skip-units` (apply config migrations only, skip unit reconciliation), `--config-dir` (persistent, default: `~/spinifex/config`), `--spinifex-dir` (persistent, default: `~/spinifex`) | Reads current config versions from registry → computes pending config migrations (from→to per target) → reads installed systemd unit versions and compares each against the copy embedded in the binary (`systemd.Reconcile` with `DryRun: true`) → prints both summaries → prompts for confirmation unless `--yes` or `--dry-run` → runs `migrate.DefaultRegistry.RunAllConfig()` to apply migrations to config files → runs `systemd.Reconcile` for real to install missing units and replace stale ones (after a timestamped backup), then `systemctl daemon-reload`. Units whose installed marker version matches the embedded one but whose content differs are left untouched and reported as operator-modified — never overwritten. Writing `/etc/systemd/system` requires root; without it, drift is still reported and the command exits non-zero rather than writing partially. Never restarts services — a unit change applies to that service's next stop. Intended for upgrades between Spinifex versions, including nodes that were upgraded by swapping the `spx` binary directly rather than by re-running the installer. Operators can skip migrations during install by setting `INSTALL_SPINIFEX_SKIP_MIGRATE=1`, then run `spx admin upgrade` manually to review and apply. After completion, services must be restarted with `sudo systemctl restart spinifex.target` to pick up config changes. Invoked non-interactively by `scripts/setup.sh` with `--yes`. |

### Account Management

| Command | Flags | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `spx admin account create` | `--name` (required) | Connects to NATS → refuses if an account already holds the name (case- and whitespace-insensitive) → reserves the name in `spinifex-account-names` KV → CAS loop on `spinifex-account-counter:next_id` for sequential 12-digit ID → creates Account record in `spinifex-accounts` KV → creates default VPC → creates `admin` user, AdministratorAccess policy (Action:*, Resource:*) and one access key → prints credentials and writes a `spinifex-<name>` AWS CLI profile |
| `spx admin account create --remote` | `--name` (required), `--endpoint` (default: this node's AWS gateway), `--region` (default: this node's region), `--ca-bundle` (default: this node's CA), `--client-token` (default: generated), `--source` (default: `spx-cli`) | Same account, created through `POST /admin/CreateAccount` over SigV4 instead of NATS — the path the public signup form uses, so a shell can exercise it. Credentials come from the standard AWS chain (env vars or `AWS_PROFILE`), never from the cluster master key; the caller must be an IAM user in the super-admin account holding `spinifex:CreateAccount`. Reuse the printed `--client-token` to retry: a fresh token would create a second account. |
| `spx admin account list` | — | Connects to NATS → IAMService.ListAccounts() → prints table with Account ID, Name, Status, Created |
| `spx admin account list --remote` | `--endpoint` (default: this node's AWS gateway), `--region` (default: this node's region), `--ca-bundle` (default: this node's CA) | Same listing read through `POST /admin/ListAccounts` over SigV4 instead of NATS, so an off-cluster operator or the load-test harness sees its tenants without SSH access to a node. Credentials come from the standard AWS chain; the caller must be an IAM user in the super-admin account holding `spinifex:ListAccounts`. |
| `spx admin account quota get <account-id>` | `--endpoint` (default: this node's AWS gateway), `--region` (default: this node's region), `--ca-bundle` (default: this node's CA) | Reads the limits in force for one account through `POST /admin/GetAccountQuota` over SigV4, and reports for each dimension whether it came from the `[quota]` block in `awsgw.toml` (`config`) or from an override stored against the account (`override`). Credentials come from the standard AWS chain; the caller must be an IAM user in the super-admin account holding `spinifex:GetAccountQuota`. |
| `spx admin account quota set <account-id>` | `--vcpus`, `--vpcs`, `--subnets`, `--eips`, `--volumes`, `--volumes-gib`, `--rds-instances`, `--load-balancers`, `--clear`, plus `--endpoint`, `--region`, `--ca-bundle` | Overrides individual limits for one account through `POST /admin/PutAccountQuota`, leaving every dimension not named inheriting the configured baseline. `-1` uncaps a dimension; `0` is a real limit that denies every request on it. `--clear` removes the whole override record and cannot be combined with a limit flag. The account must already exist. Prints the resulting limits, so a caller never has to guess what it applied. The caller must hold `spinifex:PutAccountQuota`. |
| `spx admin account delete <account-id>` | `--dry-run`, `--force`, `--yes` (requires `--name`), `--name` (account name, must match the stored record) | Prints the inventory it is about to remove → confirms the account name (prompted unless `--name` is given) → marks the account `TERMINATING`, which blocks its credentials cluster-wide → deletes its resources in dependency order (compute, attachments, storage, network, platform, identity, account), waiting for each stage to actually drain before starting the next → releases the name reservation and quota counter → deletes the account record. Anything that will not delete is reported as **stuck** with the reason, and the account stays `TERMINATING` so the residue keeps an owner. `000000000000` and `000000000001` are refused. `--dry-run` lists and changes nothing. The compute stage reaps ECS clusters, EKS nodegroups and clusters, and RDS instances before it reaps plain instances, because their backing VMs belong to the system account and a tenant-scoped instance listing cannot see them. The storage stage reaps the account's S3 buckets: uploads in flight are aborted, then the objects are removed a page at a time, then the bucket. Only buckets the account owns are ever listed, so the shared platform buckets are out of reach rather than filtered out. Bedrock model endpoints are reaped ahead of instances, because only their own delete releases the ENI and weights volume alongside the VM, and spot instance requests are cancelled first so a live request cannot launch a replacement for something already terminated. The network stage reaps load balancers, then target groups, then NAT gateways and egress-only internet gateways before the subnets, security groups and addresses they hold. The platform stage reaps ACM certificates. |
| `spx admin account delete --force` | as above | Escalates only for resources the ordinary API refuses: it clears a volume attachment in the control plane without the guest's cooperation (`ec2.ForceDetachVolume`), hard-destroys after a graceful attempt times out, and treats an already-missing resource as deleted. It never reorders the stages and never widens scope beyond the account. Use it once the guest is being destroyed — this is the escape from a volume stuck attached to an instance that will not terminate, where neither can otherwise be deleted. |
| `spx admin account delete --remote` | as above, plus `--endpoint`, `--region`, `--ca-bundle`, `--client-token` | Same teardown driven through `POST /admin/DeleteAccount` over SigV4 instead of NATS, then follows `DescribeAccountDeletion` to completion, printing each stage as it lands. Credentials come from the standard AWS chain; the caller must be an IAM user in the super-admin account holding `spinifex:DeleteAccount` and `spinifex:DescribeAccountDeletion`. |
| `spx admin principal create <name>` | `--grant` (repeatable or comma-separated; default: every admin method) | Creates an IAM user in the super-admin account with an inline `spx-admin-methods` policy allowing the requested methods, revokes any access key left from a previous run, and mints one new key. Each method is named rather than granted as `spinifex:*`, so a later addition to the admin surface is not authorised by an existing key. The principal's grants are exactly that one policy: re-running with fewer `--grant` values narrows it, and any other inline policy on the user is removed, so a rename cannot leave a wider grant behind. The secret is printed once; store it in a secret manager or an AWS profile, never in a config file. `admin` is refused as a name — it is the account's own administrator and rotating its key would revoke the bootstrap credential. |
| `spx admin principal list` | — | Lists every principal in the super-admin account with its access-key count and what it may call. An attached policy is reported by name (`AdministratorAccess (attached)`) rather than expanded, which is how an unscoped principal is spotted. |
| `spx admin principal revoke <name>` | — | Deletes every access key the named principal holds, leaving the user and its policy in place. Immediate and cluster-wide; re-issue with `principal create`. |
| `spx admin principal delete <name>` | — | Removes the principal entirely: its access keys, its inline policies and the user. `admin` is refused, as it is for `create`. Use `revoke` instead when the principal should stay and only its credential should stop working. |
| `spx admin principal audit` | — | Reports roles in the super-admin account whose trust policy names the account, its root ARN, or a wildcard. STS does not evaluate the caller's identity policy on `AssumeRole`, so any such role is assumable by a scoped admin principal, which then inherits its permissions. Exits non-zero if any role is flagged. |

### Image Management

| Command | Flags | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `spx admin images import` | `--name`, `--file`, `--distro`, `--version`, `--arch`, `--platform`, `--boot-mode` (bios/uefi/uefi-preferred), `--tag`, `--force`, `--skip-verify` | Catalog imports (`--name`) download the image, fetch the catalog `Checksum` URL, verify the SHA-256/SHA-512 digest, and inherit `BootMode` from the catalog entry. `--boot-mode` overrides the catalog value when set. Mismatch fails closed; the cached file is left on disk and `--force` re-downloads. `--file` imports skip checksum verification (operator-supplied media is outside Spinifex's trust boundary, the skip is logged at INFO for audit) and require an explicit `--boot-mode` because there is no catalog metadata to inherit from. `--skip-verify` bypasses verification for catalog imports and emits a WARN slog + stderr notice; use only for debugging or when upstream mirrors are confirmed-broken. Import never modifies the image: the bytes written to storage are the bytes that were verified. A guest that needs to trust the deployment CA for in-guest SDK-over-TLS calls fetches it at runtime from `http://169.254.169.254/spinifex/ca.pem` (see the IMDS section), so a CA rotation reaches guests without re-importing anything. |
| `spx admin images list` | — | Lists available OS images that can be imported or downloaded |
| `spx admin images promote` | `--image-id` (required), `--yes` | Reads `ami-<id>/config.json`, validates the AMI is account-owned, then rewrites `ImageOwnerAlias` to `"system"` in-place. No block data is copied. The change takes effect immediately — the AMI becomes visible to all accounts via `DescribeImages`. Prompts for confirmation (skipped with `--yes`). Already-system AMIs are refused. |
| `spx admin images remove` | `--image-id` (required), `--force`, `--yes` | Loads `ami-<id>/config.json`, walks transitive dependents — copied snapshots whose `VolumeID == imageID`, volumes whose `SnapshotID` references the internal `snap-ami-<id>` or any derived snap, and account AMIs created via `CopyImage` whose `SnapshotID` is a derived snap — then prompts (skipped with `--yes`) before deleting `ami-<id>/config.json` (the DescribeImages barrier) followed by the rest of `ami-<id>/` and `snap-ami-<id>/`. Account-owned AMIs are refused with a hint pointing at `aws ec2 deregister-image` + `aws ec2 delete-snapshot`. `--force` bypasses the dependency, ownership and config-corrupt checks for salvage of orphaned blocks. |

### GPU Management

| Command | Flags | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `spx admin gpu status` | `--node` (default: local node) | Queries `spinifex.node.status` fan-out → finds the target node response → prints Node, GPU hardware (model list or "none detected"), IOMMU state, vfio-pci state, passthrough enabled/disabled, and GPU pool allocation (`allocated/total`). Also lists GPU-capable instance types when passthrough is active. |
| `spx admin gpu enable` | — | Checks current passthrough state via NATS → errors if already enabled or prerequisites not met (directs to `setup`) → writes `gpu_passthrough = true` to `spinifex.toml` via `admin.SetGPUPassthrough` → sends SIGHUP to `spinifex-daemon` via `systemctl kill -s HUP` → polls node status for up to 30 s until daemon confirms new state → prints final `gpu status` output. Must be run directly on the target host. |
| `spx admin gpu disable` | — | Checks current passthrough state via NATS → errors if already disabled or if `AllocGPUs > 0` (must terminate GPU instances first) → writes `gpu_passthrough = false` → sends SIGHUP to `spinifex-daemon` → polls for up to 30 s → prints final `gpu status` output. Must be run directly on the target host. |
| `spx admin gpu setup` | — | Idempotent host configuration for GPU passthrough. Steps (skipped if already applied): detect GPUs via `gpu.Discover` → collect PCI IDs for all IOMMU-group siblings → check/enable IOMMU in GRUB (`intel_iommu=on iommu=pt` or `amd_iommu=on iommu=pt`) → write vfio udev rule (`/etc/udev/rules.d/99-spinifex-vfio.rules`) → blacklist nouveau (`/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf`) → blacklist amdgpu if AMD GPU present (`/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-amdgpu.conf`) → write vfio-pci early binding config (`/etc/modprobe.d/vfio-pci.conf`) → add vfio modules to initramfs. If any change requires a reboot: runs `update-initramfs -u` and exits with reboot instructions. After reboot: verifies `vfio_pci` module is loaded → verifies each GPU is bound to `vfio-pci` (binds explicitly via `driver_override` if unbound) → calls `gpu enable` to activate passthrough. |
| `spx admin gpu mig status` | — (must be run on target host) | Runs `gpu.Discover()` locally → for each GPU prints: PCI address, model, MIG capability, MIG mode (enabled/disabled/N/A); for GPUs with MIG enabled lists active MIG slices with GI ID, profile name, and mdev path. |
| `spx admin gpu mig enable` | `--profile <name>` (required, e.g. `1g.10gb`), `--gpu <pci-addr>` (optional, default: all MIG-capable GPUs) | Checks no GPU instances running (NATS) → discovers MIG-capable GPUs via `gpu.Discover()` (filtered by `--gpu` if set) → enables MIG mode on each target (`gpu.EnableMIGMode`) → lists available profiles (`gpu.ListProfiles`) and validates requested profile name → destroys any existing instances (`gpu.DestroyAllInstances`) → creates new instances filling GPU capacity (`gpu.CreateInstances`) → writes `mig_profile` to `spinifex.toml` via `admin.SetMIGProfile` → sends SIGHUP to `spinifex-daemon`. Must be run directly on the target host. |
| `spx admin gpu mig disable` | `--gpu <pci-addr>` (optional, default: all MIG-capable GPUs) | Checks no GPU instances running (NATS) → discovers MIG-capable GPUs via `gpu.Discover()` (filtered by `--gpu` if set) → destroys all GPU instances (`gpu.DestroyAllInstances`) → disables MIG mode (`gpu.DisableMIGMode`) → clears `mig_profile` in `spinifex.toml` via `admin.SetMIGProfile` → sends SIGHUP to `spinifex-daemon`. Must be run directly on the target host. |

### Ochre Weights Management

| Command | Flags | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `spx admin ochre weights stage` | `--model-id` (required), `--s3-uri` (required, `s3://bucket/prefix/`), `--tmp-dir` (default: OS temp dir) | Stages a self-host model's weights for serving. Refuses first if `--model-id` is not a self-host catalog entry (unknown or provider-served), or if `bedrock-weights` already has this model staged from the same `--s3-uri` and that snapshot still exists (no-op). If the recorded snapshot is gone (host rebuild, volume GC), it re-stages instead of refusing, so no manual `remove` is needed. Then validates the prefix holds `config.json`, `tokenizer_config.json`, at least one `*.safetensors` file, and at least one of `tokenizer.json` or `tokenizer.model`, failing before downloading anything if any are missing. Downloads the prefix's objects from predastore into `--tmp-dir`, packs them into an ext4 image (`mkfs.ext4 -d`), imports it into a new viperblock volume via `v_utils.ImportDiskImage` with `AMIMetadata` left empty (plain volume, no AMI registration), snapshots the closed volume, and records the source URI and snapshot ID against `--model-id` in the `bedrock-weights` KV bucket. Re-staging a different `--s3-uri` replaces the entry and reports the previous snapshot ID for separate reclamation. |
| `spx admin ochre weights list` | — | Lists every staged model with its source URI, snapshot ID and a STATUS column, so an operator can see why a model is (or isn't) advertised via `ListFoundationModels`. STATUS reads `OK` when the recorded snapshot still exists, or `DANGLING (snapshot missing)` when the KV record survives but its snapshot is gone. |
| `spx admin ochre weights remove` | `--model-id` (required) | Drops `--model-id`'s entry from `bedrock-weights`, hiding it from `ListFoundationModels` again. Refuses if the model has no staged entry. Never deletes the underlying snapshot or source S3 objects; reclaiming that storage is a separate, explicit act. |

### Ochre Serving Endpoints

Operator surface over the daemon's `bedrock.endpoint.*` subjects. The gateway does not request endpoints itself yet, so until it does these are the only way to start a serving VM.

| Command | Flags | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `spx admin ochre endpoint ensure` | `--model-id` (required), `--wait`, `--timeout` (default: 15m) | Asks the daemon to bring up a serving VM for `--model-id`, which must already have staged weights. Idempotent: a model already `STARTING` or `READY` returns the current record rather than launching a second VM. The daemon replies `STARTING` as soon as it has claimed the model and the launch continues in the background, so `--wait` polls `describe` until `READY` and reports the elapsed cold start. A launch that fails deletes its record, so a return to `ABSENT` is reported as an abort. A `--timeout` leaves the endpoint running rather than tearing it down. |
| `spx admin ochre endpoint describe` | `--model-id` (required) | Shows the model's current endpoint record: state, instance and node IDs, base URL, weights volume, and the derived startup time once `READY`. A model with no record reads as `ABSENT`. |
| `spx admin ochre endpoint list` | — | Lists every endpoint record with its state, instance ID and base URL. |
| `spx admin ochre endpoint delete` | `--model-id` (required) | Moves a `READY` endpoint to `DRAINING` and tears its VM down, releasing the GPU. Idempotent: an already-absent endpoint reports success. |

Self-hosted models are served from the `ubuntu-26.04-vllm-serving-x86_64` system image (`spx admin images import --name ubuntu-26.04-vllm-serving-x86_64`), built by `scripts/mkosi-build.sh --image ubuntu-vllm-serving` (`gpu-nvidia` + `vllm` profiles). It carries the tags `spinifex:managed-by=bedrock` and `spinifex:bedrock-role=vllm-serving`, which is what `LaunchServingVM` filters on rather than resolving by name. The image bakes vLLM's OpenAI-compatible server into a uv-managed venv and TEI's engine binary + CUDA runtime libraries (extracted from HuggingFace's own published CUDA image, no Docker daemon on the guest either way) side by side, one hand-stood image serving a whole co-served bundle rather than a single model. `LaunchServingVM` writes one `/etc/conf.d/bedrock-bundle/<instance>.env` file per bundle member; `bedrock-bundle-init.service` enumerates them at boot and starts one `bedrock-serve@<instance>.service` per member, which resolves and mounts that member's own cloned weights volume read-only and execs `vllm serve` (port 8000, the generative member) or `text-embeddings-router` directly (port 8001+, embedding/rerank members) — each engine's readiness is probed on the route it actually serves (`/v1/models` for vLLM, `/health` for TEI). A standalone model is the one-member case of the same path: it boots exactly as before, on port 8000.

### EKS Control-Plane Disaster Recovery

| Command | Flags | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `spx admin eks restore-snapshot` | `--cluster` (required), `--snapshot` (optional, defaults to the latest snapshot in predastore), `--account` (optional, defaults to the bootstrap account) | Single-CP total-loss DR path (fail-safe): validates the snapshot exists in predastore BEFORE any mutation (a typo'd/missing key hard-fails, never resets into an empty datastore) → launches a fresh control-plane VM as a cluster-init seed (replaying the persisted create-time launch template) → sets a required-snapshot `RecoveryDirective` (`cluster-reset`) so the boot-time recovery agent aborts rather than resets-into-empty if it cannot fetch the snapshot → persists the replacement in cluster meta BEFORE re-pointing the NLB (so an NLB failure is convergeable by the reconciler, returned as a provisional status, not a hard error) → re-points the cluster NLB's apiserver and konnectivity target groups from the old CP's ENI to the new one → fences the old CP with retries, failing loudly if it cannot be confirmed terminated (split-brain guard). Any failure before the meta commit unwinds the fresh CP (terminate + clear directive) so a re-run does not stack a second resetting control plane. The returned status is provisional — success means the sequence completed, not that etcd is restored and serving; verify cluster health. HA clusters (a spread with a potentially surviving quorum) are rejected — recover those via quorum reformation instead. |

## Private Admin API

Not an AWS API: a Spinifex-internal surface on the AWS gateway, JSON in and JSON out, one method per path segment at `POST /admin/<Method>`. It exists so a self-service signup form, a provisioning system or a load-test harness can create and remove tenant accounts without an operator shell on a node.

Requests are SigV4-signed with `service=spinifex` and the gateway's configured region (`region` in `awsgw.toml`; production is `us-west-1`). The caller must be an IAM **user** in the super-admin account (`000000000001`) holding `spinifex:<Method>` — assumed-role sessions are refused outright. Every gate denies with the same `AccessDenied`, so a caller cannot learn which one it failed. Every response carries `X-Amzn-RequestId`, repeated as `requestId` in an error body.

| Method | Request | Response | Notes |
|--------|---------|----------|-------|
| `POST /admin/CreateAccount` | `name` (email address, required), `clientToken` (32–128 chars of `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`, required), `source` (free-form provenance tag, max 64 chars) | `accountId`, `accountName`, `adminUser`, `accessKeyId`, `secretAccessKey`, `defaultVpcId` | Creates a tenant account with an `admin` user, an AdministratorAccess policy, one access key and a default VPC. The secret is returned **once**; replaying the same `clientToken` within 24 hours returns the identical response and is the only way to re-obtain it. |
| `POST /admin/DeleteAccount` | `accountId` (12 digits, required), `accountName` (must match the stored record), `clientToken` (32–128 chars), `force`, `dryRun` | `deletionId`, `accountId`, `state`; plus `inventory` when `dryRun` | Marks the account `TERMINATING` and tears down everything it owns in dependency order, then deletes the account record. Returns as soon as the teardown starts — it takes minutes, so progress comes from `DescribeAccountDeletion`. `dryRun` needs neither the name nor a token, answers inline and changes nothing. One job per account: a second call with a different token gets `OperationInProgress` while one is running. `000000000000` and `000000000001` return `AccessDenied`, the same answer an unauthorized caller gets. |
| `POST /admin/DescribeAccountDeletion` | `accountId` (12 digits, required) | `deletionId`, `state` (`RUNNING`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`), `startedAt`, `updatedAt`, `finishedAt`, `stages[]` with per-stage `deleted[]`, `stuck[]` and `elapsed`, `error` | The record outlives the account, so this stays answerable after the deletion completes. `NoSuchEntity` means no teardown was ever started for that account. A `RUNNING` job whose `updatedAt` has not advanced for five minutes is treated as abandoned — the gateway running it restarted — and a fresh `DeleteAccount` takes it over. |
| `POST /admin/ListAccounts` | — | `accounts[]` of `accountId`, `accountName`, `status`, `createdAt`; `count` | Enumerates every account. No credential material, and no paging: `[signup] max_accounts` bounds the listing. `status` is how a teardown stuck in `TERMINATING` is noticed. |

Errors are `{"error":{"code":…,"message":…},"requestId":…}`. `OperationInProgress` (409), `ServiceUnavailable` (503) and `InternalError` (500) are retryable with backoff, **always reusing the same `clientToken`** — a fresh token after a failure creates a duplicate account. `AccountAlreadyExists` (409), `IdempotentParameterMismatch` (400), `LimitExceeded` (400, `[signup] max_accounts` reached), `InvalidParameterValue`, `MissingParameter`, `InvalidRequest`, `InvalidAction`, `MethodNotAllowed` (405) and `AccessDenied` (403) are not.

Each method is a separate grant, and `spx admin principal create` decides which a credential holds. `spx admin principal create operator` grants all four — the operator and load-test credential. `spx admin principal create signup --grant CreateAccount` grants one, which is what an internet-facing signup form should hold: that key cannot reach deletion, so a compromise of the form's host cannot remove a tenant. Separate principals are the point rather than an accident: revoking either costs nothing else.

The surface is unreachable until an operator runs `spx admin principal create`; there is no config toggle and no default credential for it. The super-admin account's own `admin` user does hold these grants already, through the `AdministratorAccess` policy every account's administrator carries (`Action: "*"`), so its bootstrap key can call the surface without any further setup — but it is unscoped and unrotatable without locking out the operator, which is why automation should use a named principal. Revocation is `spx admin principal revoke <name>` (or `aws iam delete-access-key`), which is immediate and cluster-wide. `[signup] max_accounts` in `awsgw.toml` caps how many accounts may exist; it defaults to 128 when the section is absent, and 0 means uncapped.

### EC2 — Spot Instances

Spot Instance Requests (SIRs) are a **mock** over the on-demand `run-instances` path: a request synchronously launches real VMs on the operator's own compute and is then reported `active`/`fulfilled`. There is no spot market — no bidding, price rejection, interruption, or reclamation, and instances are never reclaimed.

### EC2 — Elastic IP

EIP handlers are always registered. Without a public IPAM pool (external mode disabled, or `nat` without a public pool), `describe-addresses` returns an empty list and mutating commands return `UnsupportedOperation`. In `nat` mode a public pool (`--external-pool` or `--external-source=dhcp` at init) enables the full EIP surface with host-delivered ingress.

## IMDS (Instance Metadata Service)

Available at `169.254.169.254` from inside every running guest VM, matching AWS. The endpoint is reached from within a guest over plain HTTP, with no in-VM agent to install.

**IMDSv2 by default.** Every read requires a session token unless the instance opted into IMDSv1. Obtain a token with a `PUT /latest/api/token` carrying `X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds` (1–21600), then send it back in `X-aws-ec2-metadata-token` on every read. A tokenless (v1-style) `GET` returns `401 Unauthorized` with an empty body unless the requesting ENI's instance carries `MetadataOptions.HttpTokens=optional`.

IMDSv1 is opt-in per instance via `--metadata-options HttpTokens=optional` on `run-instances` or `modify-instance-metadata-options`, on any platform, exactly as AWS does. The launch default is `required` everywhere except **Windows** images, which default to `optional` because cloudbase-init has no IMDSv2 token support in any release and would otherwise never read metadata at all. `--http-endpoint disabled`, `--http-protocol-ipv6 enabled` and `--instance-metadata-tags enabled` are still rejected with `UnsupportedOperation`.

```bash
# Inside the guest VM:
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" \
    -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 60")
curl -s -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" \
    http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id

# Tokenless GET → 401 Unauthorized (empty body)
curl -i http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id
```

### IMDS — Deployment CA

A guest that calls a Spinifex HTTPS endpoint with an AWS SDK needs the deployment CA in its trust
store. The CA is served from the IMDS responder at `/spinifex/ca.pem` — deliberately outside the
`/latest` tree, because the AWS-compatible surface stays byte-identical to EC2's and cloud-init must
never descend into a Spinifex-only path.

The route is **token-free**: a CA certificate is public material (the console already serves it
unauthenticated at `/api/ca.pem`), and requiring the IMDSv2 handshake would push a token dance into
every bootstrap snippet. The `X-Forwarded-For` SSRF guard still applies, as on every other path.

```yaml
#cloud-config
runcmd:
  # Debian/Ubuntu
  - curl -fsS http://169.254.169.254/spinifex/ca.pem -o /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/spinifex.crt
  - update-ca-certificates
```

RHEL/Rocky write to `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/spinifex.crt` and run `update-ca-trust`; stock
Alpine has no updater or anchor directory, so append the PEM to `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`.
Rotating `ca.pem` on a node is served immediately — vpcd re-reads the file when it changes.

## ELBv2 (Application & Network Load Balancer)

The data plane uses a system-managed LB VM, launched automatically during `create-load-balancer`. Application Load Balancers run **HAProxy** (L7: rules, fixed-response, redirect, HTTP/HTTPS). Network Load Balancers run **nginx `stream`** (L4: TCP, UDP, TLS, TCP_UDP) — HAProxy cannot load-balance UDP. The agent selects the engine from the `Engine` field on the config-delivery response.

## ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)

Spinifex both stores externally-issued certificates (`import-certificate`) and issues its own (`request-certificate`) for ELBv2 listener references. Certs are account-scoped; `describe`/`delete` enforce ownership, and `delete-certificate` refuses with `ResourceInUseException` while any load balancer listener still references the ARN — no force flag, matching AWS.

`request-certificate` mints a `CertificateArn` immediately and returns `PENDING_VALIDATION`; it never issues inline. The validation mode is derived from deployment state, never configured:

| Mode | Who writes the DNS record | `ResourceRecord` returned | Renewal | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PROVIDER_API` | Spinifex, via the operator's DNS provider API | none | automatic | request accepted, `PENDING_VALIDATION` — the DNS-01 order is driven by a later worker |
| `MANUAL_TXT` | the operator, by hand or Terraform | TXT, rotates per order | manual — `INELIGIBLE` | request accepted, `PENDING_VALIDATION` — same as above |
| `CNAME_DELEGATION` | operator once, then Spinifex | CNAME, stable | automatic | deferred — never selected yet (northstar cannot serve public authoritative queries); an ARN-stable delegation token is minted on every managed certificate now so this lands as a non-breaking addition |
| `PRIVATE_CA` | nobody — no validation | none | automatic | **DONE** — issues synchronously against the tenant CA, no domain outside its name constraints |

`PROVIDER_API` is selected when a DNS provider credential is configured; `MANUAL_TXT` when northstar hosts the zone; otherwise `PRIVATE_CA` — the only option for a deployment with no real, publicly delegated domain. Terraform's canonical `aws_acm_certificate` → `aws_route53_record` → `aws_acm_certificate_validation` → `aws_lb_listener` flow works unmodified in every mode: where Spinifex owns the record write, no `ResourceRecord` is emitted, so `for_each` over `domain_validation_options` yields zero records and `aws_acm_certificate_validation` still blocks correctly by polling until `ISSUED`.

## RDS (PostgreSQL and MariaDB)

Each DB instance is one dedicated system-owned VM running the engine directly, launched from the `spinifex-rds-postgres` or `spinifex-rds-mariadb` AMI, tagged `spinifex:managed-by=rds` and therefore hidden from the customer's EC2 API. The engine is reached over a customer-account ENI injected into a subnet of the DB subnet group, so **the endpoint is private — reachable from inside the VPC only**, from any subnet of it rather than the endpoint ENI's own. `Endpoint.Address` is `{db-instance-identifier}.{account-id}.{region}.rds.{base-domain}` where northstar is configured, and the endpoint ENI's private IP where it is not; the IP is stable across VM replacement either way.

**The endpoint is the only path to the engine.** The DB VM has two other NICs that no customer security group governs — a system NIC in a shared RDS system VPC, which is how the in-guest agent reaches the control plane, and a management NIC on the host's management bridge — and the engine binds neither. It binds the endpoint ENI's address alone, so the port is not open on them at all rather than open and gated. The system NIC additionally carries a dedicated region-wide security group that authorizes no ingress; agent traffic is outbound and its replies are matched by connection state. PostgreSQL's generated `pg_hba.conf` admits the customer VPC's address range and nothing wider, so a client outside the VPC is refused authentication even if it somehow reached the socket. MariaDB has no equivalent file: its analogue is the host pattern on a grant, which lives in the data volume and would follow a restore into another VPC, so for that engine the bind is the whole boundary.

Everything below applies to both engines unless it names one. `Engine` is fixed at create — there is no in-place engine change, no cross-engine snapshot restore and no migration between the two.

| | `postgres` | `mariadb` |
|---|---|---|
| Version | 18 | 11.8 |
| `EngineVersion` accepted | `18`, or omitted | `11.8`, or omitted |
| Default port | 5432 | 3306 |
| Parameter-group family | `postgres18` | `mariadb11.8` |
| Implicit default group | `default.postgres18` | `default.mariadb11.8` |
| `DBName` maximum | 63 characters | 64 characters |
| `MasterUsername` maximum | 63 characters | 80 characters |
| Reserved usernames | `postgres`, `rdsadmin`, `rds_superuser`, and the `pg_` prefix | `root`, `mysql`, `mariadb.sys`, `rdsadmin`, `PUBLIC`, and the `mysql.` and `mariadb.` prefixes |
| Catalog size | 53 parameters | 56 parameters |

**`mysql` is not an accepted engine and is not an alias for `mariadb`.** MariaDB is offered under its own AWS engine name, exactly as AWS RDS offers it. Naming `mysql` fails with `InvalidParameterValue`; a client — including Terraform's `aws_db_instance` — must set `engine = "mariadb"`. Aliasing would report an engine and a version the instance is not running, and the discrepancy would propagate into `DescribeDBInstances`, parameter-group families and snapshot metadata.

- **Engine version:** pinned per engine, and an `EngineVersion` naming anything but the pin is rejected. A minor version such as `18.4` or `11.8.8` is rejected as well: the AMI does not promise any particular minor, so accepting one would be a promise the platform cannot keep. There is no in-place upgrade.
- **Instance classes:** `db.t3.{micro,small,medium,large}` and `db.m5.{large,xlarge}` — a naming facade over the platform's EC2 sizing table. Any other class is rejected at create. **`db.X` is the EC2 instance type `X`**, so a client reads a class's vCPU count and memory from `ec2:describe-instance-types` for the identically named type; an orderable option carries neither, because AWS's own shape has no field for them. `describe-orderable-db-instance-options` reports only the classes the cluster's nodes can actually run, which on a Graviton-only cluster is none of the six — a class that would fail at launch is not offered.
- **Storage:** gp3 only, 20–65536 GiB, always encrypted with the cluster key. Grow-only, and a grow is **stop/start with downtime** — the volume cannot be resized while attached.
- **`DBName`:** optional; an omitted name creates no initial database. When supplied it must begin with a letter and hold only letters, digits and underscores, within the per-engine limit above. The rule is narrower than either engine's own, because the guest interpolates the name into a `CREATE DATABASE`.
- **TLS v1.3:** **required by default on both engines** — `rds.force_ssl` on `postgres18` and `require_secure_transport` on `mariadb11.8`, both boolean, modifiable and dynamic, both defaulting to `1`. Setting either to `0` in a parameter group restores plaintext without a reboot. Defaulting on is a **deliberate divergence** for MariaDB, which AWS leaves off.
- **What enforcement requires** is that the connection is encrypted, not that the client validates the certificate: `sslmode=require` satisfies it and does no validation at all. The engine serves a per-instance certificate signed by the cluster CA carrying both the ENI IP and the DNS name in its SAN set, so `sslmode=verify-full` — or MariaDB's `--ssl-ca` plus `--ssl-verify-server-cert` — verifies by name or by address; a client that wants to fetches the CA from the IMDS responder at `http://169.254.169.254/spinifex/ca.pem`. A deployment holding no cluster CA cannot serve TLS at all, so a group asking for enforcement is refused with `InvalidParameterCombination`, and the guest will not start an engine that could not honour it.**`go-sql-driver/mysql`** (no TLS without a `tls` DSN parameter) do not.
- **PostgreSQL master user:** administrative but **not a PostgreSQL superuser**, as on AWS. It gets `CREATEDB` and `CREATEROLE`, owns the initial database, and holds `rds_superuser` (`pg_monitor`, `pg_signal_backend`, `pg_checkpoint`) with `ADMIN OPTION`, so it can grant that set onward. It cannot `COPY ... FROM/TO PROGRAM`, touch server-side files, run `ALTER SYSTEM`, or install **untrusted** extensions — those need the cluster superuser, which no customer credential is. Trusted extensions install normally in a database it owns.
- **MariaDB master user:** created as `'<name>'@'%'` with global `RELOAD`, `PROCESS`, `SHOW DATABASES`, `REPLICATION SLAVE` and `REPLICATION CLIENT`, while application DML, DDL, routines, events, triggers and delegation are granted only on customer databases. MariaDB has no deny or partial-revoke mechanism, so granting those object privileges `ON *.*` would also grant them on `mysql.global_priv` and let the master acquire `SUPER`, `FILE` or `SHUTDOWN`. The initial `DBName` is granted automatically. Create another customer database with `CALL _spinifex_rds.create_database('name')`; plain `CREATE DATABASE`, arbitrary account administration and access to `mysql.*` are intentionally unavailable on the stock MariaDB build.
- **MariaDB storage engine:** `default_storage_engine` is platform-owned and pinned to **InnoDB**, and is absent from the parameter catalog — a deliberate divergence from AWS, which exposes it as modifiable. Only InnoDB keeps a redo log, so only InnoDB is covered by the snapshot guarantee. An explicit `ENGINE=Aria` or `ENGINE=MyISAM` on `CREATE TABLE` still works — the limitation is documented rather than prevented — but such a table has no redo log, so a snapshot taken without a successful quiesce can leave it inconsistent with no way back. Use InnoDB, as AWS also recommends.
- **Backups:** daily COW snapshots of the data volume inside `PreferredBackupWindow`. Retention defaults to 7 days and caps at 7; `0` disables automated backups. No point-in-time recovery, and MariaDB's binary log is off.
- **Availability:** single-AZ. Engine crashes restart in-guest and VM crashes on a live host restart via `ec2-health-restart`, but an instance whose host is lost is reported `failed` with a reason in `StatusInfos` and needs operator recovery.

Statuses: `creating`, `available`, `modifying`, `backing-up`, `rebooting`, `stopping`, `stopped`, `starting`, `deleting`, `failed`. (`recovering` is defined in the state machine but unreachable until auto-recovery lands.)

### RDS — DB Instances

| Command | Implemented Flags | Missing Flags | Status |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|--------|

| `reboot-db-instance` | `--db-instance-identifier` | `--force-failover` (rejected — single-AZ) | **DONE** — applies parameters marked `pending-reboot` |
| `stop-db-instance` | `--db-instance-identifier` | `--db-snapshot-identifier` (rejected) | **DONE** — the data volume and endpoint ENI are retained |
| `start-db-instance` | `--db-instance-identifier` | — | **DONE** — fresh VM, same data volume, same ENI and IP |

### RDS — Snapshots & Restore

| Command | Implemented Flags | Missing Flags | Status |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|--------|
| `create-db-snapshot` | `--db-snapshot-identifier`, `--db-instance-identifier`, `--tags` | — | **DONE** — the agent quiesces the engine first (`pg_backup_start` on postgres, `BACKUP STAGE` on mariadb); a failed quiesce falls back to a crash-consistent snapshot and writes a `DescribeEvents` warning naming what that engine does and does not recover |
| `describe-db-snapshots` | `--db-snapshot-identifier`, `--db-instance-identifier`, `--snapshot-type` (manual, automated) | `--filters`, `--dbi-resource-id`, `--include-shared`, `--include-public` (rejected), `--max-records`, `--marker` | **DONE** |
| `delete-db-snapshot` | `--db-snapshot-identifier` | — | **DONE** — refused while a restored volume still references the snapshot; the last snapshot released reclaims a retained data volume |
| `restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot` | `--db-instance-identifier`, `--db-snapshot-identifier`, `--db-instance-class`, `--allocated-storage` (≥ the snapshot's), `--storage-type` (gp3), `--port`, `--db-subnet-group-name`, `--vpc-security-group-ids`, `--db-parameter-group-name`, `--deletion-protection`, `--tags`, `--engine` (must match the snapshot) | `--db-name` (rejected when it differs from the snapshot's), plus the create rejections | **DONE** — unnamed fields are inherited from the snapshot; the master password comes from the restored datadir |
| `copy-db-snapshot` | — | all | **NOT STARTED** (`InvalidAction`) |
| `modify-db-snapshot-attribute` / `describe-db-snapshot-attributes` | — | all | **NOT STARTED** (`InvalidAction`) — cross-account snapshot sharing |

### RDS — Automated Backups

| Command | Implemented Flags | Missing Flags | Status |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|--------|
| `describe-db-instance-automated-backups` | `--db-instance-identifier` | `--filters`, `--dbi-resource-id`, `--db-instance-automated-backups-arn` (rejected) | **DONE** — one entry per instance with backups enabled; the individual snapshots are listed by `describe-db-snapshots --snapshot-type automated` |

`RestoreWindow` and `LatestRestorableTime` are deliberately absent: backups are discrete daily snapshots, and reporting a window would imply recovery to any instant inside it.

### RDS — Subnet Groups

| Command | Implemented Flags | Missing Flags | Status |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|--------|
| `create-db-subnet-group` | `--db-subnet-group-name`, `--db-subnet-group-description`, `--subnet-ids`, `--tags` | — | **DONE** (any subnet count — every subnet reports the single `spinifexz1` zone) |
| `describe-db-subnet-groups` | `--db-subnet-group-name` | `--filters`, `--max-records`, `--marker` | **DONE** |
| `delete-db-subnet-group` | `--db-subnet-group-name` | — | **DONE** — refused while any DB instance still names the group, including one that is deleting |
| `modify-db-subnet-group` | — | all | **NOT STARTED** (`InvalidAction`) |

### RDS — Parameter Groups

| Command | Implemented Flags | Missing Flags | Status |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|--------|
| `create-db-parameter-group` | `--db-parameter-group-name`, `--db-parameter-group-family` (`postgres18` or `mariadb11.8`), `--description`, `--tags` | — | **DONE** — names beginning with `default.` are reserved. **`--db-parameter-group-family` defaults to `postgres18` when omitted**, so a MariaDB group must name its family explicitly or the mismatch surfaces one call later, at `create-db-instance` |
| `describe-db-parameter-groups` | `--db-parameter-group-name` | `--filters`, `--max-records`, `--marker` | **DONE** — every engine's implicit default group is always listed, so both `default.postgres18` and `default.mariadb11.8` appear in every account |
| `modify-db-parameter-group` | `--db-parameter-group-name`, `--parameters` (ParameterName, ParameterValue, ApplyMethod) | — | **DONE** — the whole batch is validated before anything is written and propagated to attached instances; `immediate` on a static parameter is rejected, as AWS does |
| `describe-db-parameters` | `--db-parameter-group-name`, `--source` (user, engine-default) | `--filters`, `--max-records`, `--marker` | **DONE** — the catalog of the group's own family: 53 parameters on `postgres18`, 56 on `mariadb11.8`. Memory defaults are computed per instance class and reported as literals |
| `delete-db-parameter-group` | `--db-parameter-group-name` | — | **DONE** — refused for a default group and while any instance references it |
| `reset-db-parameter-group` | — | all | **NOT STARTED** (`InvalidAction`) |

A group takes effect on an instance when `modify-db-instance --db-parameter-group-name` attaches it — immediately with `--apply-immediately`, otherwise at the next maintenance window. Later group edits propagate to every attached instance. Dynamic parameters are written into the engine's config and reloaded live; static ones are recorded `pending-reboot` and applied by `reboot-db-instance`.

**A group's family must match the instance's engine.** A `postgres18` group cannot be attached to a MariaDB instance and a `mariadb11.8` group cannot be attached to a PostgreSQL one, on create, on modify, on a deferred apply or on a snapshot restore; the mismatch is refused with `InvalidParameterCombination`. The catalogs are per-family too, so `modify-db-parameter-group` will not store one engine's parameter name into the other's group. Each catalog is a curated, validated subset rather than the engine's full variable set, and the platform-owned settings — the port, the datadir, the socket, the bind address, the certificate and key paths, and on MariaDB `secure_file_priv`, `log_bin`, `default_storage_engine` and the InnoDB buffer-pool chunk settings — are absent from it rather than present-and-unmodifiable, because they are not the customer's to set. The exception is a setting AWS exposes as modifiable that this platform pins: the TLS floor is present as `ssl_min_protocol_version` and `tls_version` and reported as not modifiable, so a Terraform plan that sets it is refused as policy rather than reading as a platform gap.

### RDS — Tags

| Command | Implemented Flags | Missing Flags | Status |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|--------|
| `add-tags-to-resource` | `--resource-name` (db, snapshot, subgrp, pg ARNs), `--tags` | — | **DONE** |
| `remove-tags-from-resource` | `--resource-name`, `--tag-keys` | — | **DONE** |
| `list-tags-for-resource` | `--resource-name` | `--filters` | **DONE** — `describe-db-instances` reports the same tags in `TagList` |

### RDS — Events

| Command | Implemented Flags | Missing Flags | Status |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|--------|
| `describe-events` | `--source-type` (db-instance, db-snapshot), `--source-identifier`, `--event-categories`, `--duration`, `--start-time`, `--end-time`, `--max-records` | `--marker` | **DONE** — 100-event ring per resource, 14-day retention, one-hour default window |

### RDS — Engine Versions & Orderable Options

| Command | Implemented Flags | Missing Flags | Status |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|--------|
| `describe-db-engine-versions` | `--engine`, `--engine-version`, `--db-parameter-group-family`, `--filters` (`engine`, `engine-version`, `db-parameter-group-family`, `status`) | `--default-only`, `--include-all`, `--list-supported-character-sets`, `--list-supported-timezones` (accepted, provably no-ops), `--max-records` (accepted, no effect), `--marker` (rejected) | **DONE** — one row per engine |
| `describe-orderable-db-instance-options` | `--engine` (required), `--engine-version`, `--db-instance-class`, `--license-model`, `--vpc`, `--filters` (`engine`, `engine-version`, `db-instance-class`, `license-model`, `vpc`) | `--max-records` (accepted, no effect), `--marker`, `--availability-zone-group` (both rejected) | **DONE** — the engines crossed with the classes the cluster's nodes can run |

Both are read from the tables the create path validates against, so an engine pin bump or a class-map change moves these answers with it. Neither paginates — at most 2 engine versions and 12 orderable options — so no `Marker` is ever returned, and one supplied is rejected rather than answered as page one, where the other RDS describes parse and ignore it.

- **`AvailabilityZones` and `AvailableProcessorFeatures` are always empty**, and are gaps only in appearance: `--availability-zone` is rejected on create and `--processor-features` is ignored, so naming either here would advertise a knob that does nothing.
- **Only the classes the cluster's nodes can run are offered.** A cluster that answers nothing is `ServerInternal`, never the full class list; one that answers and runs none of them is an empty list. Free capacity is deliberately not consulted — exhausted capacity is a create-time failure, and filtering on it would make a Terraform data source return a different answer on every plan.

Two further deliberate divergences: the four `describe-db-engine-versions` booleans are accepted as **provable identities** rather than the "parsed, not applied" the other describes document, because one version per engine and two empty lists leave them nothing to change; and `--filters` on `describe-orderable-db-instance-options` is **applied** where AWS documents it unsupported. Both actions reject an unrecognised filter name, and a non-boolean `vpc` value, with `InvalidParameterValue` rather than ignoring it — stricter than AWS rather than looser.

### RDS — Rejected Parameters

Policy: a parameter whose omission would create a false safety, security or availability guarantee is rejected with `InvalidParameterValue` rather than silently dropped. Parameters that are merely inert — `AutoMinorVersionUpgrade`, `CopyTagsToSnapshot`, `DeleteAutomatedBackups`, Performance Insights and Enhanced Monitoring fields — are accepted as no-ops.

| Parameter | Why it is rejected |
|-----------|--------------------|
| `MultiAZ=true` | Single-AZ platform; a standby would not exist |
| `PubliclyAccessible=true` | The endpoint is a private VPC address |
| `StorageEncrypted=false` | Unencrypted storage is not offered |
| `EnableIAMDatabaseAuthentication` | IAM database authentication is not implemented |
| `Iops`, `StorageThroughput`, `StorageType` ≠ `gp3` | Provisioned performance classes are not implemented |
| `KmsKeyId`, `TdeCredentialArn` | Storage is encrypted with the cluster key, not a customer-managed one |
| `AvailabilityZone` | The platform exposes a single zone |
| `AvailabilityZoneGroup` (orderable options) | It selects a zone or local-zone group, and naming a zone is already refused |
| `DBSecurityGroups` | EC2-Classic security groups — use `VpcSecurityGroupIds` |
| `DBClusterIdentifier`, `DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` | Clustered engines are not offered |
| `EnableCloudwatchLogsExports` | Log export is not implemented |
| `EngineVersion` other than the engine's pin, `Engine` on modify | No in-place engine or version change |
| `Engine=mysql` (and Aurora engines) | Oracle MySQL is not offered; `mariadb` is a distinct engine, not an alias for it |
| `NewDBInstanceIdentifier` | The identifier is the DNS label and the KV key |
| `DBPortNumber`, `DBSubnetGroupName` on modify | Both would move the endpoint |
| `MaxAllocatedStorage` | Storage autoscaling is not implemented |
| `ManageMasterUserPassword`, `RotateMasterUserPassword` | Secrets Manager integration is not offered |
| `CACertificateIdentifier` | The serving certificate is minted from the cluster CA |
| `Domain`, `DomainFqdn` | Active Directory domain join is not offered |
| `OptionGroupName` | Option groups are not offered |
| `CustomIamInstanceProfile` | The DB VM's instance profile is platform-owned |
| `EnableCustomerOwnedIp` | An Outposts feature |
| `ForceFailover` (reboot) | No standby to fail over to |
| `DBSnapshotIdentifier` (stop) | Snapshot-on-stop is not implemented |

### RDS — Not Yet Implemented

Recognised actions below return `OperationNotSupported`, so a client sees "not offered" rather than a typo'd action name. Everything else in the `rds` namespace returns `InvalidAction`.

| Feature | Actions | Priority | Status |
|---------|---------|----------|--------|
| Oracle MySQL engine | — | Low | **NOT PLANNED** — MariaDB is offered instead, under its own `mariadb` engine name; see the note above on why it is not aliased onto `mysql` |
| Point-in-time recovery (WAL archiving to predastore on postgres, binlog on mariadb) | `restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time` | High | **NOT STARTED** |
| Auto-recovery from node loss (failure is detected, not repaired) | — | High | **NOT STARTED** |
| Read replicas | `create-db-instance-read-replica`, `promote-read-replica` | Medium | **NOT STARTED** |
| Aurora / DB clusters | `create-db-cluster`, `modify-db-cluster`, `delete-db-cluster`, `describe-db-clusters`, `failover-db-cluster` | Low | **NOT STARTED** |
| Option groups | `create-option-group`, `modify-option-group`, `delete-option-group`, `describe-option-groups` | Low | **NOT STARTED** |
| Multi-AZ standby, online (no-downtime) storage grow, storage autoscaling, IAM database auth, Performance Insights, Enhanced Monitoring, log exports, per-tenant private DNS zones, enforced TLS, cross-engine snapshot restore, in-place migration between the two engines | — | — | **NOT STARTED** |

IAM: `AmazonRDSFullAccess` and `AmazonRDSReadOnlyAccess` are available as managed policies. They grant `rds:` verb prefixes rather than `rds:*`, because `rds:*` would also appear to grant the internal agent actions the gateway reserves for a DB VM's own role.
