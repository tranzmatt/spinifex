## Overview

This guide builds Spinifex from source. For production deployments, the [binary installer](/docs/install) is recommended.

**Supported Operating Systems:**

- Ubuntu 26.04
- Debian 13

## Instructions

## Step 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Development/mulga && cd ~/Development/mulga
git clone https://github.com/mulgadc/spinifex.git
sudo make -C spinifex quickinstall
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

## Step 2. Clone Sibling Repositories

```bash
cd spinifex
./scripts/clone-deps.sh
```

This clones Predastore (S3) and Viperblock (EBS) alongside Spinifex.

## Step 3. Development Initialisation

```bash
./scripts/dev-install.sh
```

This bootstraps a single-node development environment: builds binaries, configures OVN, initialises the cluster, installs the CA certificate, and starts all services.

## Step 4. Verify Installation

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=spinifex
aws ec2 describe-instance-types
```

If this returns a list of available instance types, your installation is working.

**Congratulations! Spinifex is installed from source.**

Continue to [Setting Up Your Cluster](/docs/setting-up-your-cluster) to import an AMI, create a VPC, and launch your first instance.

## Troubleshooting

### Go Not Found in PATH

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

### CA Certificate Not Trusted

```bash
sudo cp /etc/spinifex/ca.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/spinifex-ca.crt
sudo update-ca-certificates
```
