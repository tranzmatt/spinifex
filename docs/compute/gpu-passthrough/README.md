## Overview

Spinifex supports VFIO-based GPU passthrough, binding NVIDIA and AMD GPUs directly to guest VMs via the `vfio-pci` kernel driver. Once configured, the node exposes GPU-enabled EC2 instance types and the GPU is allocated exclusively to individual instances.

At startup, Spinifex always probes for GPU hardware and surfaces the result in the node banner and in `spx top nodes` — regardless of whether passthrough is enabled. This lets operators verify hardware before activating the feature.

The passthrough state is reflected in the login banner:

> **Note:** GPU passthrough is supported on x86_64 hosts only.

## Prerequisites

- IOMMU must be supported and enabled in the host BIOS/UEFI (`Intel VT-d` or `AMD-Vi`).
- An NVIDIA or AMD GPU must be physically installed.
- The Spinifex node must be running on bare metal (not inside a VM).

## Instructions

### Host Setup

Run the one-time host configuration as root. This command is idempotent — safe to re-run after a reboot.

```bash
sudo spx admin gpu setup
```

What it does:

1. Detects installed GPUs and their PCI IDs.
2. Enables IOMMU in GRUB (`intel_iommu=on iommu=pt` or `amd_iommu=on iommu=pt`).
3. Writes the vfio udev rule (`/etc/udev/rules.d/99-spinifex-vfio.rules`).
4. Blacklists `nouveau` (NVIDIA) and `amdgpu` (AMD) so the host kernel does not claim the device.
5. Configures `vfio-pci` early binding in `/etc/modprobe.d/vfio-pci.conf`.
6. Adds vfio modules to initramfs.

If any change requires a reboot, the command prints instructions and exits:

```
Setup complete — reboot required.
  sudo reboot
  Then run: sudo spx admin gpu enable
```

### Enable Passthrough

After setup and reboot, enable GPU passthrough:

```bash
sudo spx admin gpu enable
```

The command writes the configuration, signals the daemon (`SIGHUP`), and waits up to 30 seconds for the daemon to confirm the new state. On success it prints the current GPU status.

### Status and Monitoring

**Per-node status:**

```bash
spx admin gpu status
# or for a specific node in the cluster:
spx admin gpu status --node <node-name>
```

Output includes hardware detected, IOMMU state, vfio-pci binding, passthrough enabled/disabled, GPU pool allocation (`allocated/total`), and the GPU-capable EC2 instance types available on that node.

**Cluster view:**

`spx top nodes` includes a `GPU (used/total)` column:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `1/2` | Passthrough active — 1 of 2 GPUs allocated |
| `0/1*` | Node has a GPU but passthrough is not enabled |
| `-` | No GPU hardware detected |

```bash
spx top nodes
```

### GPU Instance Types

GPU instance types are derived from detected hardware. To list available GPU instance types on the current node:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instance-types \
  --filters Name=instance-type,Values=g*
```

### Launching GPU Instances

Spinifex ships two pre-built GPU guest images. Import the one that matches your host hardware before launching:

```bash
spx admin images import --name ubuntu-26.04-nvidia-gpu-x86_64   # NVIDIA hosts
spx admin images import --name ubuntu-26.04-amd-gpu-x86_64      # AMD hosts
```

These images are built on Ubuntu 26.04 and serve as a base for GPU workloads. Both include Docker CE, Python 3, and common utilities (`git`, `curl`, `htop`, `tmux`, `ffmpeg`).

**NVIDIA** (`ubuntu-26.04-nvidia-gpu-x86_64`): NVIDIA server driver with DKMS pre-built against the image kernel, `nvidia-smi`, nvidia-container-toolkit wired into Docker (`--gpus all` works on first boot). CUDA toolkit and cuDNN are not included — use an NGC container or install inside the instance.

**AMD** (`ubuntu-26.04-amd-gpu-x86_64`): `linux-firmware` (amdgpu firmware blobs), ROCm 7.2 CLI tools (`rocm-smi`, `rocminfo`, `amd-smi`). Full ROCm compute libraries (`rocblas`, etc.) are not included — install inside the instance as needed.

Launch a GPU instance:

```bash
aws ec2 run-instances \
  --image-id $GPU_AMI \
  --instance-type $INSTANCE_TYPE \
  --key-name spinifex-key
```

To verify the GPU is visible from inside the instance, SSH in and run:

```bash
# NVIDIA
nvidia-smi

# AMD
rocm-smi
```

### Disable Passthrough

Passthrough cannot be disabled while GPU instances are running. Terminate all GPU instances first, then:

```bash
sudo spx admin gpu disable
```

The command signals the daemon and waits for confirmation. The GPU is released back to the host kernel on the next reboot (the vfio-pci binding persists until `setup` is re-run without the blacklists).

## Troubleshooting

### IOMMU not active after reboot

Verify IOMMU is enabled in BIOS/UEFI (`Intel VT-d` or `AMD-Vi`). Then check GRUB picked up the parameters:

```bash
cat /proc/cmdline | grep iommu
ls /sys/kernel/iommu_groups/
```

If `/sys/kernel/iommu_groups/` is empty, IOMMU is not active. Re-run `sudo spx admin gpu setup` after enabling it in firmware.

### GPU bound to native driver instead of vfio-pci

```bash
lspci -k | grep -A3 -i "vga\|3d\|display"
```

If the driver is `amdgpu` or `nvidia` rather than `vfio-pci`, the blacklist or early binding did not take effect. Re-run setup and reboot:

```bash
sudo spx admin gpu setup
sudo reboot
```

### `spx admin gpu enable` fails with "prerequisites not met"

Run `setup` first to configure the host, then retry `enable`:

```bash
sudo spx admin gpu setup
sudo spx admin gpu enable
```

### Daemon does not confirm within 30 seconds

Check the daemon log for errors:

```bash
journalctl -u spinifex-daemon -n 50
```
