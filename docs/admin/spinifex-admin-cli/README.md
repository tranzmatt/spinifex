## Overview

The `spx` binary is the central administration tool for managing your Spinifex infrastructure. It provides commands for cluster initialization, account management, node operations, VM lifecycle, and service control. All services in the Spinifex platform are managed through this single binary.

**Binary location:** `/usr/local/bin/spx`

## Instructions

## Account Management

Create a new isolated account. This provisions a sequential 12-digit account ID, an `admin` user with an `AdministratorAccess` policy attached, and an access key pair. The credentials are written to `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config` under a `spinifex-<name>` profile automatically.

```bash
spx admin account create --name myteam
```

```
Account created successfully!
  Account ID:        000000000002
  Account Name:      myteam
  Admin User:        admin
  Access Key ID:     AKIA1A2B3C4D5E6F7890ABCD
  Secret Access Key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
  AWS Profile:       spinifex-myteam

Use with:
  AWS_PROFILE=spinifex-myteam aws ec2 describe-instances
```

> **The secret access key is only shown once.** It is saved to `~/.aws/credentials` on the node where you ran the command; copy it from there if you need it elsewhere.

Set the profile to start using the account:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=spinifex-myteam
```

To create additional users and scoped permissions within the account, see [IAM Users and Policies](/docs/iam-users-and-policies).

List all accounts:

```bash
spx admin account list
```

```
ACCOUNT ID     NAME                 STATUS     CREATED
----------     ----                 ------     -------
000000000000   system               ACTIVE     2026-07-03 02:17
000000000001   spinifex             ACTIVE     2026-07-03 02:17
000000000002   myteam               ACTIVE     2026-07-03 03:32
```

## Node Management

List nodes in the cluster:

```bash
spx get nodes
```

```
NAME    STATUS    IP              REGION           AZ               UPTIME   VMs
node1   Ready     127.0.0.1       ap-southeast-2   ap-southeast-2a  2m       0
node2   Ready     127.0.0.2       ap-southeast-2   ap-southeast-2a  2m       0
node3   Ready     127.0.0.3       ap-southeast-2   ap-southeast-2a  2m       0
```

## Monitor Resources

```bash
spx top nodes
```

Prints per-node CPU/memory usage and cluster-wide instance type availability.

## Image Management

```bash
spx admin images list
spx admin images import --name debian-13-arm64
```

Catalog imports verify the image against the catalog-declared SHA-256/SHA-512 digest before extraction. Use `--file` to import operator-supplied media (verification skipped — operator is responsible for integrity), or `--force` to re-download after a checksum mismatch.

### EKS node image

To run EKS, import the prebuilt node image from the catalog:

```bash
spx admin images import --name spinifex-eks-node
```

This pulls the Alpine + K3s node AMI from `iso.mulgadc.com`, verifies its
checksum, and registers it tagged `spinifex:managed-by=eks`. `eks create-cluster`
and `eks create-nodegroup` resolve the boot AMI by that tag, so no further
configuration is needed.

## Cluster Shutdown

Coordinated, phased shutdown of the entire cluster — running VMs are stopped before storage and control-plane services:

```bash
spx admin cluster shutdown
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied Running Spinifex

The binary may not be executable. Fix permissions:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/spx
```

If you get permission errors during operations, ensure you're running with appropriate privileges. Some OVN and networking commands require `sudo`.

### Services Fail to Start

Check the daemon logs for specific errors via `systemctl`/`journalctl`:

```bash
systemctl status 'spinifex-*'
journalctl -u spinifex-daemon -f
journalctl -u 'spinifex-*' -f
```

Common causes include port conflicts, missing OVN configuration, or untrusted CA certificates.
