# ECR (Container Registry)

> Spinifex's ECR service is an AWS-compatible, OCI-compliant container registry. You create repositories with `aws ecr`, authenticate Docker with a registry token, and `docker push` / `docker pull` exactly as you would on AWS — and your EKS clusters can pull from it directly.

## Overview

ECR on Spinifex serves a private container registry on the Spinifex gateway endpoint — the same `host:9999` you already use for the AWS API. Authentication is account-scoped by token, so you push and pull at the gateway host and never need extra DNS:

```
<spinifex-gateway-host>:9999/<repository>
```

`aws ecr describe-repositories` and `aws ecr get-login-password` return the exact host to use — always prefer that value. Where real DNS is configured, the AWS-parity per-account host `<account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.<your-spinifex-domain>:9999` also works.

Each repository holds image manifests and their layers. Images are stored in object storage ([Predastore](https://github.com/mulgadc/predastore)) in a per-account bucket, with blobs content-addressed and de-duplicated across repositories. Authentication is token-based: `aws ecr get-login-password` mints a short-lived bearer token that `docker login` uses against the registry's `/v2/` endpoint.

**What works today**

- Repository lifecycle — `CreateRepository`, `DeleteRepository`, `DescribeRepositories`.
- OCI push and pull — blobs, manifests, and tags, including cross-repository blob mounts.
- Token auth — `GetAuthorizationToken` plus bearer/basic auth on `/v2/`.
- Repository policies — set, get, and delete a repository policy document.

**Current limitations**

- **Image scanning is not supported** — scan APIs return an explicit "operation not supported" error.
- **No automatic garbage collection yet** — deleting images does not yet reclaim underlying blobs.
- Lifecycle-policy enforcement and tag-immutability enforcement are not active.

## Prerequisites

- **Spinifex running**, with the AWS CLI configured for the `spinifex` profile (see [Installing Spinifex](/docs/install)).
- **Docker** installed locally to build, push, and pull images.
- **Docker trusting the Spinifex CA.** The registry serves TLS signed by the Spinifex local CA. Install it into the host trust store once (Docker uses the host root pool for registry TLS, so this covers every account endpoint without per-host config):

```bash
sudo cp /etc/spinifex/ca.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/spinifex-local-ca.crt
sudo update-ca-certificates
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

- **The registry endpoint** — the Spinifex gateway `host:9999`. `aws ecr get-login-password` and `aws ecr describe-repositories` return the exact `host:port`; copy it from there rather than constructing it by hand.
- **For EKS pulls:** worker nodes need the `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly` policy on their node IAM role (the EKS prerequisites already include this) and network egress to the registry endpoint.

## Instructions

Create a repository and push an image using your preferred tool.

:::tabs
@tab AWS CLI

### 1. Create a repository

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=spinifex

aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-app
aws ecr describe-repositories --repository-names my-app \
  --query 'repositories[0].repositoryUri'
```

The `repositoryUri` is the value you tag and push to — the gateway `host:9999`
with the repository path, port included (for example `192.0.2.10:9999/my-app`).
Use it verbatim; don't hand-build a hostname.

### 2. Authenticate Docker

Take the registry host straight from the API so the `:9999` port is correct:

```bash
REGISTRY=$(aws ecr describe-repositories --repository-names my-app \
  --query 'repositories[0].repositoryUri' --output text | cut -d/ -f1)

aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> \
  | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin "$REGISTRY"
```

### 3. Build, tag, and push

```bash
docker build -t my-app:latest .
docker tag my-app:latest "$REGISTRY/my-app:latest"
docker push "$REGISTRY/my-app:latest"
```

### 4. Verify and pull

```bash
aws ecr describe-images --repository-name my-app
docker pull "$REGISTRY/my-app:latest"
```

@tab Spinifex UI

From the left navigation open **ECR → Repositories**.

<img src="ecr-list-repositories.png" alt="The ECR Repositories list in the Spinifex console, showing a repository with its registry URI, tag mutability, and creation date">

### 1. Create a repository

1. Click **Create Repository**.
2. Enter the **repository name** and, optionally, set **tag mutability** (mutable or immutable).
3. Submit — the repository appears in the list with its full registry URI.

### 2. Copy the push commands

Open the repository to see its detail page. The **Push commands** panel lists the exact `aws ecr get-login-password | docker login`, `docker build`, `docker tag`, and `docker push` commands, pre-filled with your registry host and repository URI — use the **Copy** button and run them locally.

### 3. Manage the repository

- The **Permissions** tab edits the repository's access policy.
- The **Lifecycle** tab manages retention rules, and **Tag immutability** can be toggled from the detail page.
- The **Scan** tab reflects that image scanning is not supported on Spinifex.
- Delete a repository from the **Delete** action in the repositories list.

@tab Terraform

Repositories can be managed as code with the standard `aws_ecr_repository` resource, with the AWS provider pointed at Spinifex's `ecr` endpoint:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region                      = "ap-southeast-2"
  skip_credentials_validation = true
  skip_requesting_account_id  = true

  endpoints {
    ecr = "https://<your-spinifex-gateway>"
  }
}

resource "aws_ecr_repository" "my_app" {
  name = "my-app"
}

output "repository_url" {
  value = aws_ecr_repository.my_app.repository_url
}
```

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=spinifex
tofu init
tofu apply
```

Then authenticate Docker and push using the `repository_url` output, following steps 2–4 in the AWS CLI tab.

## Troubleshooting

**`docker login` fails with an authorization error.** The token is account-scoped and short-lived. Re-run `aws ecr get-login-password` to mint a fresh token, and confirm the registry host in `docker login` matches your account's endpoint (`aws ecr describe-repositories` returns it).

**`docker push` cannot reach the registry.** Use the exact host from `aws ecr describe-repositories` — the Spinifex gateway `host:9999`. Docker dials it directly, so the `:9999` port must be present (without it docker tries `:443` and fails). If you are using the AWS-parity `<account-id>.dkr.ecr…` hostname instead, that path needs DNS resolving it to the gateway — prefer the gateway host the API returns.

**EKS workers cannot pull an image.** Confirm the node IAM role has `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly` and that the workers have egress to the registry endpoint (an Internet Gateway or NAT Gateway route). See the [EKS prerequisites](/docs/eks).

**Image-scanning commands return an error.** Image scanning is not supported on Spinifex; the scan APIs intentionally reject these calls. Remove scan-on-push configuration from your tooling.

**A pushed image still appears after deletion frees no space.** Garbage collection of unreferenced blobs is not yet automatic — deleting an image removes its manifest and tags but does not immediately reclaim the underlying layers.
